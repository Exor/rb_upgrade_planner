# Runeblade Artefact Upgrade Planner

This simple page computes the costs and benefits of upgrading artefacts
in [Runeblade](http://everyweargames.com/runeblade/), an Apple Watch game
by [everywear games](http://everyweargames.com/). Credit for this work goes to
[GameShaman](https://www.reddit.com/u/GameShaman),
I have just added the latest artefacts and split the HTML, CSS, and JS in separate
files.

I have left the script I use to publish this to an [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)
bucket just as a reference, all it does is minify the code and upload it.

The page is online [here](http://rb.shm.me), pull requests are welcome.
